    <h1>Welcome to Enchantress of Numbers Math Games!</h1>
    <p>Inspired by the mathematician Ada Lovelace, we programmed these games to teach math skills.</p>
    <p>Ada Lovelace was a brilliant woman who is credited as the first programmer. She wrote pseudocode for the Analytical Engine, and theorized that one day such a machine would be able to compose music.</p>
    <p>Sadly, her code never ran in her lifetime as the machine was just a concept, but people have taken her work and coded it, and discovered that it does work!</p>
    <p>We hope that these math games encourage students to study math!</p>

    <p>The game teaches how to add matrices. Given two matrices, add them together to get (x, y) coordinates. Click the boxes that have the coordinates to win!</p>
