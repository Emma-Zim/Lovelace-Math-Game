    <header>Welcome to Enchantress of Numbers Math Games!</header>
    <p>We've created these games to teach students math skills. We were inspired by Ada Lovelace as she was a brilliant mathematician.</p>
    <p>Her skill with numbers gave her the nickname "Enchantress of Numbers" and she is credited as the first computer programmer for her work on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. She theorized that the machine could be used to calculate infinite sums and maybe one day be able to compose music.</p>
    <p>She coded the first program for the machine- which sadly was never able to run since the machine was never fully built. But people have taken her work and coded it to discover that it does work!</p>
