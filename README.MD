Lovelace Math Games
Learn math from the Enchantress of Numbers herself!

These games were created for the Girls Hoo Hack Hackathon.

Inspired by the mathematician Ada Lovelace, we programmed these games to teach math skills.
Ada Lovelace was a brilliant woman who is credited as the first programmer. She wrote pseudocode for the Analytical Engine, and theorized that one day such a machine would be able to compose music.
Sadly, her code never ran in her lifetime as the machine was just a concept, but people have taken her work and coded it, and discovered that it does work!
We hope that these math games encourage students to study math!

There are four games created: a Blackjack addition game, a matrix addition game, a find largest number, and find smallest number game.

These games run in our web browser (Chrome is the only browser we have tested it on) and they require JavaScript so please make sure that in installed and running in your browser!
